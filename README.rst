Python Object Extractor
=======================

Extract a Python object (like class, function, etc) with its dependencies from
a local project into a stand-alone module with a requirements file.


Use cases
---------

The primary use case of this tool is to allow views of a web app's backend to
stay organized and conforming to DRY principle while at the same time to be
able to be deployed to serverless computing platforms like AWS Lambda,
GCP functions, Azure Functions, etc with minimal weight and dependencies'
installation time.

Any other use cases are welcome as well.


Deliverables
------------

Package provides executable ``python-object-extractor``.


Synopsis:

.. code-block::

  usage: python-object-extractor [-h] [-p PROJECT_PATH] [-m OUTPUT_MODULE_PATH]
                                 [-r OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS_PATH]
                                 [-n OUTPUT_OBJECT_NAME]
                                 object_reference

  Extract Python object with its dependencies from local project.

  positional arguments:
    object_reference      reference to object to extract. Example:
                          'importable.module:object'

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -p PROJECT_PATH, --project_path PROJECT_PATH
                          path to local project directory (default: .)
    -m OUTPUT_MODULE_PATH, --output_module_path OUTPUT_MODULE_PATH
                          path to output Python module containing extracted
                          object, for example, 'main.py'. Use '-' to output to
                          STDOUT (default: -)
    -r OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS_PATH, --output_requirements_path OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS_PATH
                          path to output requirements file, for example,
                          'requirements.txt'. Use '-' to output to STDOUT
                          (default: -)
    -n OUTPUT_OBJECT_NAME, --output_object_name OUTPUT_OBJECT_NAME
                          output name of target reference. By default it's taken
                          from 'object_reference'. For example, for object
                          reference 'importable.module:object' an output object
                          name will be 'object'  (default: None)


Usage examples
--------------

Extract a function from a package located in current directory and print to
``STDOUT``:

.. code-block:: bash

  python-object-extractor package.module:function


Extract a function from a package located in current directory, name it as
``main`` and print results to ``STDOUT``:

.. code-block:: bash

  python-object-extractor package.module:function -n main


Extract a function from a package located in a given directory and print results
to ``STDOUT``:

.. code-block:: bash

  python-object-extractor package.module:function -p /path/to/project


Extract a function from a package located in a given directory and save results
to files ``main.py`` and ``requirements.txt``:


.. code-block:: bash

  python-object-extractor package.module:function -p /path/to/project -m ./main.py -r ./requirements.txt
